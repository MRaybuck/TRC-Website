      <hr><h2 class="intro-text text-center">PROPOSED<strong> Solution and Alternatives</strong></h2></hr><br>
      <p align="justify">

        Our proposed solution involves a demand responsive rumble strip mechanism which becomes active (lowers) only when needed. Making the rumble strips active only when needed prevents drivers from becoming accustom to the effects while minimizing the nose as compared to permanent rumble strips. Hence, drivers’ attention will be regained making them aware of the presence of pedestrians in the roadway. In addition, in the context of autonomous vehicles, the proposed mechanism provides redundancy so as to minimize the likelihood of a crash as a consequence of system failures and/or malfunction. In the context of connected vehicles, the proposed mechanism can be activated through communication with vehicles and pedestrians. We have filed a non-provisional penitent of our invention in partnership with the UNLV Office of Economic Development. The corresponding technical drawings and details have been provided to the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
  Other alternative engineering mechanisms such as rapid-flashing beacons are unlikely to provide the same strong effects as the rumble strips as evidenced by the fatalities that have occurred in areas that have these beacons. One of the advantage of the demand-responsive rumble strips is the level of rapid vibration/discomfort that they produce. Hence, drivers are instinctively and immediately forced to regain attention to the roadway; even before they see a pedestrian. This is the same proven effect as shoulder rumple strips have on drivers. There is not a similar product in the market. All available alternatives require the drivers to be looking at the roadway and the surrounding infrastructure. Distractions such as cell phone use, impaired driving, interaction with passengers, or external disturbances are frequent and preclude the intended effect of warning the drivers about the presence of pedestrians on the roadway. The demand-responsive rumble strips create the required effect even in the presence of distractions as the vibration creates the involuntary reaction of regaining their attention to the roadway. In addition, other alternative solutions do not address the emerging needs associated with autonomous vehicles.
  In addition to pedestrian areas, there are several other applications of the automated rumble strips.  Some of the additional areas where they could be placed are at railroad crossings and toll booths. In recent years there have been several accidents attributed to inattentive drivers at both these types of facilities. The recent Amtrak accident on US95A in Nevada where six people were killed is just one example. Just as we have already mentioned, in these areas there were rapid-flashing beacons along with railroad crossing arms that were ineffective at regaining the drivers’ attention. Not to mention the cost of the railroad crossing arms and the flashing lights. On average these devices cost well over $ 600,000 to install at each crossing. It is anticipated that our automated rumble strips in addition to these devices will be effective at regaining distracted drivers’ attention for only an additional fraction of the overall cost of these standard installations. In terms of financial benefits to the community, a fatality in Nevada is estimated to be more than $ 5.5 M. Similarly, the cost of injuries are extremely high. On average, a single injury is likely to be more expensive than the cost of the proposed automated rumble strips. These cost estimates are according to the Highway Safety Manual.
